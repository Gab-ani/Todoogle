# Todoogle

A software designed to organise curiosity.

Have you ever heard of must-to-read book but forget about it in an hour?

Have you ever been curious to research a theme closer, but wasn't able to do it during a moment?

Most people see "save post" as a solution, but no saved post can remind about itself, thus leading to great graveyards of recipes, book/film lists etc.

With todoogle you can set something interesting to remind you about itself. It's as easy as google something, but you also setting a date and time, for example, todays 21:30. Todoogle will save your queries and send you an email containing your questions. Even better, not only it will remind you about them, the text is hyperlinks to exact same query in google search.
